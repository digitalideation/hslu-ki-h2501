   - Title: **“LLMs are slot‑machines”** (16 Aug 2025 on Pluralistic) ([pluralistic.net][1])
     - In it, Doctorow argues that large language models (LLMs) behave like slot machines: the vendor’s incentive is _not_ to simply solve your problem once, but to keep you interacting longer (i.e., pay more, repeat queries).
     - He writes: “When you are paying by the ‘pull of the handle,’ the vendor’s incentive is not to solve your problem with a single pull, but to give the appearance of progress…” which points to commercial/monetisation incentives built into LLMs. ([pluralistic.net][1])
     - While the article doesn’t explicitly say “fine-tuned for product placement,” it _is_ about how LLMs are monetised and could steer user behaviour — which is very close to the concept you mentioned.
