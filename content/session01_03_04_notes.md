# 👩‍🏫 Lecturer's Notes

### Learning Goals

- Help students connect **abstract philosophical ideas** to **AI systems and design**.
- Encourage reflection on the **nature of perception**, embodiment, and experience.
- Develop skills in **conceptual thinking**, not just technical analysis.
- Foster curiosity and critical reflection about **AI’s limitations and assumptions**.

### Key Takeaways

| Concept           | Student Understanding Goal                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Berkeley**      | Perception defines existence — _without being perceived, the world is nothing._ Connect this to how AI “sees” data.                               |
| **Merleau-Ponty** | Perception is embodied — _we perceive through our physical engagement with the world._ Compare this to embodied AI and robotics.                  |
| **AI Reflection** | AI can process sensory data but lacks subjective experience. Understanding this helps clarify the boundary between _simulation_ and _experience._ |

### Teaching Tips

- Keep activities short — 5–10 minutes max — and emphasize _thinking through examples_, not formal philosophy.
- Avoid jargon; encourage students to describe what they feel, observe, or imagine.
- If students use an LLM, remind them that they’re analyzing **how AI explains philosophy**, not whether it’s “right.”
- Encourage humor and creativity — it helps demystify the philosophers.
- End the session by linking back to the technical side:

> “What would it take for an AI to _really_ perceive? More data, or something like a body?”
