So is man an unnatural animal?

Man is a denatured animal.

Just look at a little human animal at birth. A baby, if it had to rely solely on its nature to survive, it wouldn't get very far, and would probably even die quite quickly, its instincts being far too weak to guide it.

Whereas, for example, a small foal will instinctively succeed in walking, and even trotting, within a few dozen minutes,

The little human animal - the one you call a baby - fails an average of 2,000 times before succeeding in putting one foot in front of the other. It will take 18 months of painstaking learning to succeed in doing what the foal knows instinctively how to do in less than an hour.

In short, we're failed animals.

Yes, well, that's precisely why we're accomplished humans.

Our natural instinct is faulty, because we were born too early, we're all very premature.
It takes about 18 months for the embryo's cells to develop all the way, but as you may know, after 9 months we're thrown into existence, unfinished and dependent, intangible and fragile.

But this is also our greatest opportunity.

Well, because we don't know how to do things instinctively, because our nature supports us so poorly, we compensate with culture.

Receiving advice from elders, being educated by parents or older people, going to school, reading books, watching tutorials, relating to others.

Because we don't know how to do things instinctively, we'll proceed by trial and error, by failure and learning, by trial and error and progress.
And in the end, we'll get much further than if we'd known how to do things instinctively.

There are virtues in failure.

The little foal may be able to walk in 20 minutes, but I've never seen a single foal succeed in riding a bike, drive a car, fly a plane or even just play rugby.

Because our nature supports us so poorly, we will turn to others and receive their love, support, empathy, precisely to compensate for this failure of our natural instinct.
Basically, we develop our culture because our nature is failing, and that's fine, but there's more to it than that.

Because we are failed animals, not defined by our nature, nor determined by the solidity of our instinct, we can invent ourselves.
Invent ourselves as this or that, become progressive or reactionary, kind or mean, just or unjust, competent or incompetent, luminous or obscure.

Well, this failure of nature within us opens up an immense space for our freedom.

To quote one of the most famous quotations in philosophy, existence precedes essence.
Well, that's exactly what it means. If we had a nature, then we'd have an essence, and we wouldn't be able to invent ourselves in this freedom.

This freedom is our opportunity as well as our anxiety, it's our water as well as our responsibility, it's as exciting as it is tiring.
In the end, we have to ask ourselves if it isn't this freedom, our freedom, that makes us so happy.

George Berkeley (/ˈbɑːrkli/;[5][6] 12 March 1685 – 14 January 1753) – known as Bishop Berkeley (Bishop of Cloyne of the Anglican Church of Ireland) – was an Anglo-Irish philosopher whose primary achievement was the advancement of a theory he called "immaterialism" (later referred to as "subjective idealism" by others). This theory denies the existence of material substance and instead contends that familiar objects like tables and chairs are ideas perceived by the mind and, as a result, cannot exist without being perceived. Berkeley is also known for his critique of abstraction, an important premise in his argument for immaterialism.[7]

Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous is a book written in by George Berkeley in 1713. The most important concepts in the Three Dialogues are: perceptual relativity, the conceivability ("master") argument and Berkeley's phenomenalism. The perceptual relativity argument is that different objects can appear to have different characteristics (e.g. shape) depending on the observer's perspective. Since objective features of objects cannot change without an inherent change in the object itself, then shape must not be an objective feature.

Maurice Merleau Ponty
Merleau-Ponty emphasized the body as the primary site of knowing the world, a corrective to the long philosophical tradition of placing consciousness as the source of knowledge, and maintained that the perceiving body and its perceived world could not be disentangled from each other
